We are expanding!

### Modern technologies
Interested in using ES6 and ES7? Or using top notch frameworks like React.js? Want to use build tools like Webpack? Or create beautifull CSS using the SASS preprocessor? Hell yeah, that is how we roll at Flipbase. We are a young company, we iterate quickly, we build things fast. No scrum or agile work procedures.

### Develop 
We build JavaScript plugins for a living. We like to be lightweight, performant and flexible. However, even a solid plugin does not work without an environment. So, to showcase our cool plugins, we need a demo environment. You will be solely responsible for the front-end development of this demo development. 

## You
You dream in HTML5 and CSS3. You think in vanilla JavaScript and know your way around when it comes React.js and ES6. 
Advanced level of English (or Dutch) is required. Communications are not always fun, but hell they are important.

## You get
a) Money
b) As much freedom as you like (and with that comes... yes, responsibility). And yes heres the catch: as long as you deliver the goods. It's not even necessary to relocate. Just, propose us a plan how to communicate and how can build fellowship and commitment along the way.
c) 25 days of paid leave
d) To work a product that is seen daily by near 1.000.000 people worldwide. 

Ow, and.. as a developer you at least need to know how our 'recorder' plugin works. So, please record a 5 second video and say electronically hi to us. We will hi you back :)
